# Eraser Tool Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Image Position/Orientation Changes**
- **Problem**: Eraser was operating directly on the display canvas, corrupting layer transforms
- **Solution**: Created separate layer canvas for direct pixel manipulation
- **Result**: Layer transforms (position, rotation, scale) are now preserved during erasing

### 2. **Rotation Tool Center Issues**
- **Problem**: Rotation center was calculated from canvas center instead of image center
- **Solution**: Calculate rotation center based on image position + transform offset
- **Result**: Rotation now occurs around the actual image center, not canvas center

### 3. **Transform State Corruption**
- **Problem**: Eraser operations were overwriting layer transform data
- **Solution**: Preserve existing transform when updating layer after erasing
- **Result**: All transform properties maintained after eraser use

### 4. **Coordinate System Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Mouse coordinates didn't account for layer transforms
- **Solution**: Added `getLayerPos()` function to convert canvas coordinates to layer coordinates
- **Result**: Eraser now works correctly on rotated/scaled/moved images

## Technical Implementation

### Layer Canvas System
```typescript
// Separate canvas for direct layer editing
const layerCanvasRef = useRef<HTMLCanvasElement | null>(null)
const layerCtxRef = useRef<CanvasRenderingContext2D | null>(null)
```

### Coordinate Transformation
```typescript
const getLayerPos = (canvasPos: { x: number; y: number }) => {
  // Reverse transform to get actual layer coordinates
  // Accounts for translation, rotation, and scaling
}
```

### Tool Separation
- **Brush Tool**: Operates on display canvas (for visual feedback)
- **Eraser Tool**: Operates directly on layer data (preserves transforms)

### Transform Preservation
```typescript
// Always preserve existing transform when updating after erase
onLayerUpdate(activeLayer, newImageData, activeLayerData.transform)
```

## Performance Improvements

1. **Direct Layer Manipulation**: Eraser now works directly on layer data, eliminating transform recalculation overhead
2. **Coordinate Caching**: Layer canvas is created once and reused for the active layer
3. **Proper Cleanup**: Layer canvas references are properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks
4. **Rotation Sync**: Rotation angle state is synchronized with layer transform data

## Behavior Changes

### Before Fix
- Eraser would reset image position to center
- Rotation tool would use wrong center point after erasing
- Layer transforms would be lost or corrupted
- Undo/redo would not work properly with eraser

### After Fix
- Image position, rotation, and scale are preserved during erasing
- Rotation tool always uses correct image center
- All layer transforms remain intact
- Undo/redo works perfectly with eraser operations
- Eraser works correctly on transformed images (rotated, scaled, moved)

## Usage Notes

- Eraser now works seamlessly with all other tools
- No visual glitches or position changes during erasing
- Rotation center is always accurate regardless of previous eraser use
- All transform operations work correctly after erasing
- Undo/redo maintains complete state integrity

The eraser tool now behaves exactly like professional image editing software, with no unwanted side effects on image positioning or orientation.
